# Chargers that will not disconnect any existing devices when new devices plug in.
This public list aims to organize USB-C chargers that renegotiate power without disconnecting any existing devices.  
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this list. The “Buy Link” may be sponsored. Additionally, contributors of new records can use their sponsored link to incentivize collaboration and co-authoring this list.  
  
In the `Reconnect?` column, $\sf\color{lightgreen}No$ indicates that the charger can maintain the connection between connected devices without the need for renegotiation. This is considered a good outcome.

[^Belkin]:  DPs saying it disconnects [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/r9r1nf/normal_for_usb_c_multiport_chargers_to/iflcr3n/), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypPZszqLxts)
[^SlimQ]:  if you exceed 100w then all get disconnected until you unplug and replug
[^ISDT]: All its USBC port are seperate 65W with max 200W in total. So there will be no disconnect at all. It also have a screen that shows current power draw of each ports. But the clock on the screen is not accurate.
[^Ugreen]: all Ugreens disconnect
[^Anker2]: but it's superfast at reconnecting
[^Asometech]: there are three zones, it only disconnects if you plug into the same zone
